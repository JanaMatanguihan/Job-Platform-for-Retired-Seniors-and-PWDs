            <p class="one">The city of Manila has partnered with McDonald's to offer job opportunities to senior citizens and persons with disabilities (PWDs). Under a memorandum of agreement signed on March 12, the program will provide jobs for seniors and PWDs at McDonald's outlets in Manila, with three such individuals being hired per outlet.</p>

            <p class="two">Positions available include order presenters, drink drawers, table managers, and guest relations staff, with a work schedule of no more than four hours a day.</p>

            <p class="three">The program offers benefits such as 13th-month pay, service incentive leaves, and company group insurance. Additionally, the Manila government will cover medical requirements, including physical exams and "Fit to Work" certifications.</p>

            <p class="four">To assist applicants, the Manila Police will waive police clearance fees and set up special lanes for seniors and PWDs.</p>

            <p class="five">Mayor Honey Lacuna highlighted that the initiative aims to reintegrate senior citizens and PWDs as productive members of society, and the program has been praised by Senior Citizen Partylist Rep. Rodolfo Ordanes for making Manila a "Capital City of Equal Opportunity."</p>
