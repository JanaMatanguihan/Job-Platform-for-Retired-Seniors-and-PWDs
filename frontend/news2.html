        <div class="txt my-4">
            <p>In the Philippines, authorities have signed contracts with private companies to provide employment opportunities for senior citizens and persons with disabilities (PWDs), aiming to alleviate poverty among these groups.</p>
            <p>Manila City Mayor Honey Lacuna announced a partnership with an Asian pizza company to offer jobs to retirees and PWDs, allowing them to work in positions like counter staff or supervisors in quality control, provided they are "fit to work." The initiative avoids physically demanding tasks like lifting furniture.</p>
            <p>Additionally, agreements have been made with online food and grocery delivery services to allow retirees and PWDs to participate in packaging and logistics. These efforts are driven by studies showing that many elderly Filipinos struggle financially after retirement, with a significant number ending up on the streets due to lack of savings.</p>
            <p>The St. Vincent de Paul Foundation, which operates a retirement home, praised the initiative, noting that many of its elderly residents became homeless after retirement due to financial difficulties. Providing employment would help reduce street dwelling and prevent begging.</p>
            <p>The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines also supported the program, emphasizing that jobs for PWDs in industries like food service would uplift their status, urging the public to show kindness and compassion toward people with disabilities.</p>
